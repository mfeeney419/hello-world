# hello-world
My first repository - home base for the new guy

About me: 

I'm a middle-aged nobody who is in the midst of a massive career change. I've always been enthralled by computers, and I've even dabbled a bit in programming - back when my elementary school gave us TRS-80's to learn BASIC.  So, yeah.  Old.  I'm a big music guy and a community organizeer.  I've started two community music ensembles for those of us who miss having performance in our lives, but didn't pursue a career in the arts. 

Fun Times for all

I'm a problem solver and an analytical thinker, but every step I gain in my programming career teaches me how much I DIDN't know about logical thought and organization. This switch is going to be very good for me.
